# calculator

This is a simple browser calculator made in vanilla JavaScript. Supports multiple equations.


-custom made function for the operations (no eval() used!)
-full keyboard support: type operators and operands just like
you would as usual, using the numbers over the QWERTY, OR/AND the numpad. Press backspace, to delete the last digit, or delete to clear entry. Press enter to calculate the result:
    - shift * multiplication (or numpad *)
    - / (division)
    - shift + for addition (or numad +)
    - - (subtract)
    - shift ^ (power) 
    - n (factorial)
